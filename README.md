To run the application, make sure that you have all the requirements installed. This can be done by typing 
pip install -r requirements.txt (Python 2), or pip3 install -r requirements.txt (Python 3) in the command line. 


Once requirements have been installed, call the runserver command in the manage.py file. 
This can be done by typing 
python manage.py runserver (Python2), or python3 manage.py runserver (python3) in the command line.
